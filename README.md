# pi-meridian-extension

Use your **Claude Max subscription** through [pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent) via [Meridian](https://github.com/rynfar/meridian) — a local proxy that bridges the Anthropic Messages API with Claude Code SDK authentication.

Without this extension, pi's default system prompt triggers an `"You're out of extra usage"` error on Claude Opus 4.6 (and potentially other models) when routed through Meridian. This extension rewrites the system prompt **only for Meridian requests** to avoid that issue, while leaving all other providers untouched.

## What it does

- **Registers a `meridian` provider** with the current Meridian Claude models (Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6, Opus 4.7, Haiku 4.5)
- **Rewrites the system prompt** for Meridian requests to avoid the extra-usage error, preserving project context and working directory
- **Auto-starts Meridian** on session start if the proxy isn't running
- **Adds commands**: `/meridian` (health check), `/meridian start`, `/meridian version`

## Models

| ID | Name |
|----|------|
| `meridian/claude-sonnet-4-6` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 |
| `meridian/claude-opus-4-6` | Claude Opus 4.6 |
| `meridian/claude-opus-4-7` | Claude Opus 4.7 |
| `meridian/claude-haiku-4-5` | Claude Haiku 4.5 |

Use them with `--model`, e.g. `--model meridian/claude-opus-4-7:high`.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-meridian-extension
```

Requires [Meridian](https://github.com/rynfar/meridian) installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g @rynfar/meridian
```

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `MERIDIAN_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:3456` | Meridian proxy URL |
| `MERIDIAN_API_KEY` | `meridian` | Bearer token sent to Meridian. Set this to the same value as the Meridian daemon when upstream API-key auth is enabled. |
| `MERIDIAN_PROFILE` | unset | Optional Meridian profile ID sent as `x-meridian-profile` for multi-profile setups. |

## Subagent Compatibility

When using pi-subagents with custom agent definitions (`.md` files in `~/.pi/agent/agents/`), you must add the meridian extension to each agent's `extensions:` frontmatter. Without this, user-defined agents spawn with `--no-extensions`, which strips all global extensions — including this one — so the `meridian` provider won't be available.

Add the meridian extension path to your agent's frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-agent
extensions: /path/to/other/extension.ts, /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/pi-meridian-extension/extensions/index.ts
---
```

> **Note**: This is only needed for user-defined agents with explicit `extensions:` in their frontmatter. Builtin agents (like `delegate`) inherit global extensions automatically.

## Switch to Meridian

After installing, switch your model in pi:

```
/model meridian/claude-opus-4-7:high
```

Or use it for a single command:

```bash
pi --model meridian/claude-opus-4-7:high
```

## Commands

- `/meridian` — health check (connection status, runtime version, auth, mode)
- `/meridian start` — start the Meridian daemon if not running
- `/meridian version` — check installed vs latest version, update availability

## How the prompt rewrite works

When `provider === "meridian"`, the extension hooks `before_provider_request` and replaces the full system prompt with a concise version that:

1. Identifies as Claude Code operating through Meridian for pi
2. Preserves your `# Project Context` section from the original prompt
3. Preserves `Current date:` and `Current working directory:` lines
4. Drops pi's heavy default prompt that triggers the extra-usage error

All other providers continue to use pi's default system prompt unchanged.
